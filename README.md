<h1 align="center">Milestone Project 3 - Home Cooking</h1>

[View project here](https://home-cooking-milestone3-proj.herokuapp.com/)

This interactive site is based around individuals who would like a place to keep their recipes all 
in one place as well as share it with the rest of the world. Being able to create new recipes, 
edit and delete recipes on demand from the computers to their mobile phones. They would have the chance to write 
down the ingredients needed and the steps required to make the specific dish. 
If any issues arise, they would have the chance to reach out to the site administrator by sending them an email. 

This site would be utilizing Python which was taught from the Code Institute as well as using MongoDB. 
I will be using various technologies as well such as HTML5, CSS3, JQuery and Materialize. 
This project will be responsive and accessible to different size browsers and devices.

## User Experience (UX)

### The Audience

The intended audience for this project is all individuals, from students who are about to leave home for the first time to go 
to universities and want to write down Mums cooking, all way to individuals who like to experiment in the kitchen but need a 
place to remember what they have done.  

### User Objectives

To have a place to store customised recipes and for them to be accessed anywhere from any device. The user would be able to 
register to begin the journey of adding a recipe to their account. From there, they would be able to log in and create their recipe. 
They would be able to add the ingredients and steps taken to make their dish once saved. The user would have the option to edit, 
delete and even share their recipes because by default all recipes would be set to private. 

The user would be able to edit their recipes and if they are logged into their account. Users who do not have an account but can 
see shared recipes, will not be able to edit or amend recipes. If the user is trying to look for something, there would be search 
functionality for them to be able to search by ingredient or by the name of the dish. Once all is achieved, the user can log out. 
If the user is trying to look for something, there would be search functionality for them to be able to search by ingredient or 
by the name of the dish. Once all is achieved, the user can log out. 

### My Objectives

My objectives are going to be achieved by taking images from free image stock websites that would have images of recipes, meals and 
kitchen crockery that I want to advertise. The recipes and ingredients would be taken from other websites to use as the data being 
pulled from the database. The users would be able to contact the site admin if they have any queries or questions as it would 
incorporate a contact form that would be linked to a live email address. The site would have a registration form and a login/logout 
functionality to allow users to have their profiles. It would also have validation included with error messages if 
the username or password is wrong.

The site would have a CRUD software architectural style (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for basic operations of persistent storage 
with the recipes being added by the users. Validation would also be in this part of the site as only the recipe owner would be able 
to edit and share the specific recipe.

The navigation bar and footer would be built within the base file and the content for the rest of the site would be built within 
their specific .html files. Within the footer, there would be social media links that would connect the user to the sites alternative 
social platforms.

## User Stories

The intended type of users for which this site would be focused towards are individuals who would like to store their 
homemade recipes online

1. As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so I can have my own profile.
1. As a user, I want an error message to appear if I typed my username/password incorrectly so I can attempt again with the correct username/password.

## Design

-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The colour scheme I will be working with is mainly white but with a touch of off-white/yellow colour to portray cooking and the light of food. The text colour will be black to keep the text easy to read (Will be using WebAIM to check the contrast of the colour scheme).

-   #### Typography
    -   I have chosen to use [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) and [Heebo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo) 
    font as the main fonts throughout the website with Sans Serif as the emergency font in the case for any reason 
    the font is not being imported into the site correctly. Both [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather)
    and [Heebo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo) are attractive fonts to use as it easy to clear and easy to read, they are also has a touch formality 
    without being formal.

-   #### Imagery
    -   The images that were used are based on the content of what it is portraying. Displaying ingredients, finished 
    meals and kitchen crockery without diverting them for the task they need to complete.

I was also utilising Chrome Dev Tools to assist with changes when code was not working as planned. Within Chrome Dev Tools, I was also utilising the responsive views to see the development for the responsive sizes. To test the JS that I was using, I would be using Chrome Dev Tools and choosing Console to make sure everything was running smoothly.

In this section, I would be testing the User Stories taken from the User Experience Section (UX), testing the functionality and usability, testing the responsive views as well as browser testing

### Validation

#### HTML - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

- Validating all the HTML files, the only standard HTML error I received that I did not add the "alt" attribute to the img element.

- Helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code.
- Everthing was passwed apart from one warning sign which is as expected as JSHint is using an old version of ES

#### Python - [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) - [Results](documentation/images/pep8-validator.png)

- Only needing to fix the line too long error, the python file passed without any further issues.

### Further Testing

#### User Stories Testing from User Experience (UX) Section - [View Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-3/blob/master/documentation/testing-md-docs/user-testing-ux.md)

When carrying out the User Stories Testing, I placed my self as the user being provided instructions on how to achieve the goals that were identified. The intended type of users which this website is targeted for are individuals who looking for and/or looking to store recipes. I displayed screenshots with the results of each finding to provide evidence of the stories being achieved successfully.

#### Functionality and Usability Testing - [View Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-3/blob/master/documentation/testing-md-docs/features-function-testing.md)

Testing all my functions and features within the site and ensuring that it is usable across different browsers and devices. I laid the results out in a table with each section defining the feature/function, a description of what I am testing as well as if it passes or fails.

#### Browser and Responsive Testing

All tests which have been mentioned in the link above has been tested on the following browsers: Chrome, Edge and Firefox. All features and functions worked as expected, including the addition of UX designs (excpet for the known issues mentioned below). The site was also tested on different size devices which consisted of a laptop 13 inch, a tablet as well as a mobile phone.

### Known Issues

- The space between the carousel and the header is to big when changing the device size. 
- The alignement of the cards vs the hearder not perfectly in middle, where as even the buttons within the cards are not perfect aligned in the middle.

## Deployment

### Making a Deployment

The project was deployed to Heroku and connected to GitHub pages using the following method:
1. To direct Heroku which application and dependencies are required to run the app being developed, 
create a requirements file.
    - In the terminal, enter "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt"
1. Install the Procfile file as that what Heroku looks for to know which files run the app and how to.
    - In the terminal, enter echo web: python app.py>Procfile
    - Note:  In the Procfile, there could be a blank line automatically created, go into the file, remove the blank line and save it again.
1. In [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), click on 'New', then click on 'Create new app'.
1. Providing it with a unique name and changing the region to 'Europe' (or whatever region you are in). Then click on 'Create app'.
1. In 'Deployment method' click on 'GitHub', Ensuring your GitHub username is visible, either 
search for your repository or type in exactly how your repository is spelt in GitHub. 
When it finds your Repository, it will be visible and you would click on 'Connect'
1. Scroll to the top of the page and click on 'Settings'.
1. Scroll down till you are in 'Config Vars' section and since we hide the environment variables. It would need to be 
added into Heroku manually. You would need to add the following: IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME, ensuring you putting the same values as you did in the env.py file
1. Going back to the terminal within GitPod. Commit and push the files that were created.
1. Once successfully pushed into GitHub, go back to Heroku and click on 'Enable Automatic 
Deployment' and then 'Deploy Branch'.
1. Once completed, a 'View' button would appear meaning the app has been deployed and successfully connected to Github.
1. As Heroku is now connected to Github, for the remaining for project, upload your files into GitHub and it would automatically sync with Heroku.

### Making a Clone

I had to get the SSH key from the repository which allowed me to clone the repository to my local hard drive. 
The method which I used to clone the project was via the terminal as well as Github Desktop. I was able to connect my Github repository and clone my files through this method. 

<img src="documentation/images/making-a-clone.png">

#### Step 1 - Method 1 (Steps taken in VSCode)
1. Open your IDE and open up the Terminal
1. Inside your terminal type `git clone git@github.com:adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-3.git`
    - This would clone what is in github to your computer and so now modification to the files can happen on your local machine
1. Inside your terminal type `git status`
    - To see what changes have been made
1. Type `git -a`
    - To add all the files that you have worked on to the stage
1. Type `git commit -m "add notes here"`
    - To add a message to files you are about to push to the servers
1. Type `git push`
    - To upload to the remote repository

#### Step 1 - Method 2
1. Open the repository that needs to be cloned.
1. On the top-right side of the page, above the files, you will see a button 'Code' with an arrow point down.
1. Once clicked, a drop-down would appear which would give me the option 'Open with GitHub Desktop' 
(as I had already pre-installed [GitHub Desktop]() previously).
1. Once clicked, it would automatically open the application and request where for it to be saved.

#### Step 2 - Create Env.py
1. Create a new file in the dictory called 'env.py'
    - In the terminal type in `git touch env.py`
1. Inside the env.py file you will need to add the following:
```
# Python env code to set all defaults

import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "yourkeyhere")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "yourmongouriaddress")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "yourdatabasename")

3. Need to install the project requirements from the requirements.txt file.
    - In the terminal type in `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. log into [MongoDB]() to create your database and the tables
    - Mapping of database available [Here]()
1. Within the app.py file, scroll to the bottom of the page and change the code from 
```
# This tells the application where and how to run.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host=os.environ.get("IP"),
            port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
            debug=False)
``` 
To
```
# This tells the application where and how to run.

### Content

The content which i have used for most of my recipes are from the gym that i got to [Any Time Fitness Connect](https://connect.anytimefitness.co.uk/wellbeing/nutrition/recipes/)

### Code

Utilising the code that was used taught from the Code Instute Lessons consisted of (HTML5, CCS3, JavaScript and Python), i also utilised other sources which assisted me in the developing the specific areas.
 
- [Hoover Effects](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - Effects when hovering over buttons
- [Back button functionality](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000317.htm)
- [Contact Modal](https://www.emailjs.com/)
    - Using emailJS service to send emails from the contact form
- [Code Acadamy - Mini Project (Task Manager)]()
    - Snippets of the code were taken from the mini-project (Task Manager) provided by Code Institue throughout the site.
- [Error Handling](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-vii-error-handling)
    - Code within the app.py file to see the function.

### Acknowledgements

I want to thank my mentor Aaron Sinnott who guided me in the right direction and for his support. This project has allowed me to experience the powers of Python, MongoDB and much more. It has enabled the developer/me to code in a much easier and kicker way without duplicating efforts.

I also want to thank the Code Institure tutorials especially the Task Manager project for helping me to build and achieve this project. The project was developed around a personal problem of mine and that was a method in storing recipes that my mum would give me. This also became a problem for my sister which enhanced the concept of the site. We needed a way to store and edit, share and delete recipes.
